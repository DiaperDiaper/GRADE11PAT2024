    <h2 align=center><u>Phase 1 Information:</u></h2>
    <br>
<h3 align="center"><u>What The Current Situation?</u></h3>

<p>South Africa is facing a growing issue with electronic waste (e-waste) due to the rapid increase in electronic device usage and disposal. Improper disposal of e-waste leads to environmental contamination and poses significant health risks due to toxic substances. There is a lack of widespread awareness and infrastructure for proper e-waste management in South Africa.</p>
<br>
<h4 align="center"><u>E-waste As A Growing Concern In South Africa </u></h4>
<p>E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electrical and electronic devices such as computers, phones, and household appliances. It contains toxic substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can pose serious health and environmental risks if not properly managed. In South Africa, improper e-waste disposal is a growing concern, contributing to issues like soil and water contamination, respiratory problems, neurological damage, and even cancer. Vulnerable populations, including children and those living near informal recycling sites, are particularly at risk.</p>
<br>
<h4 align="center"><u>South African Initiatives And Challenges</u></h4>
<p>The country has several initiatives to address e-waste, such as the e-Waste Association of South Africa (eWASA) and various drop-off points, take-back schemes, and recycling facilities. However, challenges remain in expanding infrastructure, raising public awareness, and ensuring proper disposal. Innovations in e-waste management, such as advanced recycling technologies and product designs that promote easier recycling, are emerging to tackle these issues.</p>
<br>
<h4 align="center"><u>Health Care Professionals And The Role They Play</u></h4>
<p>Healthcare professionals also play a key role in educating the public about the health risks of e-waste. Through patient consultations, community outreach, and demonstrating sustainable practices, they can raise awareness and advocate for responsible disposal methods, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable future.</p>

    <h2><u>Phase 2 Information:</u></h2>
    <p>Working through various information collecting application like Excel, we surveyed a total of 35 partipants, to further gather information on South African e-waste and how it effects the population.</b></p>

    <h4><u>Summary of Findings</u></h4>
    <p><i>The data reveals a high level of awareness of the term "e-waste" among respondents, with most being familiar with the concept. A smaller portion has some familiarity, and only a few are unfamiliar, indicating that e-waste is generally well-known within the group.</p>
<p>When it comes to health risks posed by hazardous materials in electronic devices, most respondents recognize these risks as significant or very significant. Only a few view the risks as moderate or slight, while a minimal number do not perceive any substantial danger. This suggests that there is widespread concern about the health impacts of hazardous materials in e-waste.</p>
<p>Awareness of specific hazardous materials is somewhat mixed. While many respondents have some awareness, there remains a degree of uncertainty among others. This highlights the need for increased education on the topic.</p>

<p>Survey results also reflect concerns about the health effects of e-waste, with several participants experiencing related health issues and noting community-level concerns. Despite this, many are unaware of local protective measures or regulations. However, there is strong belief that manufacturers should take responsibility for managing the risks associated with electronic devices. This suggests a demand for better regulation and accountability in e-waste management.</i></p>
